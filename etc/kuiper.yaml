sink:
  # The cache persistence threshold size. If the message in sink cache is larger than 10, then it triggers persistence. If you find
  # the remote system is slow to response, or sink throughput is small, then it's recommend to increase below 2 configurations.
  # More memory is required with the increase of below 2 configurations.
  # If the message count reaches below value, then it triggers persistence.
  cacheThreshold: 10
  # The message persistence is triggered by a ticker, and cacheTriggerCount is for using configure the count to trigger the persistence procedure
  # regardless if the message number reaches cacheThreshold or not. This is to prevent the data won't be saved as the cache never pass the threshold.
  cacheTriggerCount: 15
