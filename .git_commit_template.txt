# Type should be one of the following:
# * feat (new feature)
# * fix (bug fix)
# * docs (changes to documentation)
# * style (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change)
# * refactor (refactoring production code)
# * test (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
# * chore (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)
# Scope is just the scope of the change. Something like (admin) or (teacher).
# Subject should use impertivite tone and say what you did.
# The body should go into detail about changes made.
# The footer should contain any JIRA (or other tool) issue references or actions.

# ## Usage ##
#
# Put the template file here:
#
#     ~/.git_commit_template.txt
#
# Configure git to use the template file by running:
#
#     git config --global commit.template ~/.git_commit_template.txt
#
# Add the template file to the ~/.gitconfig file:
#
#     [commit]
#       template = ~/.git_commit_template.txt
#
# If you prefer other file locations or ways of working,
# you can freely adjust the usage as you like.
